                <h3>Li Bao - Factory Girl</h3>

                <p>At just 17 years old and a newcomer to the industry, Li is the latest hire at a Chinese manufacturing and assembly facility in the Guangzhou province. Without this modern-day Rosie the Riveter, you wouldn't have your favorite videogame console!</p><p>Her entry-level salary of $50/month, combined with 11-hour work days (<em>not</em> including overtime!) made her a can't-miss for this list! She lives in a company dorm (that she pays for!) with a dozen of her coworkers, which means she and her dorm mates can bring that extra <em>oomph</em> of synergy to the workplace.</p><p>Do you think she'd come assemble furniture at my house this weekend? I'm overdue for an IKEA trip!</p>

                <h3>Akua Aidoo - E-Waste Scavenger</h3>
                <img style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" width="50%" src="http://www.oeko.de/files/aktuelles/image/pjpeg/e-waste_ghana_006.jpg">
                <p>You've probably seen Akua on this list before! She's 10 years old and recycles the metal from your discarded hardware. She crawls over and into large piles of "e-waste" to find valuable parts that have small amounts of copper, aluminum and steel. This lil' entrepreneur brings back her high-tech haul to an older woman who maintains a fire; the tech-trash is then burned in the open air to separate the metal from the plastic, which is smelted into a sellable form! She'll make $0.22 to $9.50 a day doing this.</p><p>Provided she doesn't die of lung damage due to toxic fumes, burns, tetanus, or cancer due to concentrated exposure to dioxin emissions, we expect her to be on this list for years to come!</p>
